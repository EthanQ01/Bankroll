						<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>

						<p>
							Ambitious and detail-oriented cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in Governance, Risk, and
							Compliance (GRC) and cybersecurity consulting. I bring over three years of hands-on experience in network
							security, incident response, and cybersecurity policy development across diverse corporate environments.
							Adept at bridging the gap between technical complexities and actionable solutions, I excel in communicating
							advanced concepts to non-technical audiences, driving strategic decision-making, and enhancing organizational
							security postures.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a former NCAA Division 1 football athlete, I maintained Presidential Honor Roll and Dean’s List recognition
							throughout my academic career while balancing a demanding schedule of athletics, full-time internships, and
							academic coursework. This experience sharpened my resilience, leadership, and time management skills, proving
							my ability to thrive under pressure.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ve competed in multiple hackathons, earning finalist spots and winning one, and have attended cybersecurity
							conferences such as FutureCon to stay ahead of industry trends. My technical expertise includes Python, Java,
							Proofpoint, Splunk, and other key tools, with a solid grasp of risk analysis, vulnerability assessment, and policy
							development. Open to relocation, I am seeking opportunities within dynamic, forward-thinking organizations that
							invest in growth and innovation while allowing me to expand my knowledge and contribute to impactful solutions.
